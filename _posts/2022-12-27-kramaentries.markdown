Guest mix at KRAMA entries radio show on Movement Radio. 

> During the past year, I accidentally became a cassette collector, at the bazaars of Slemani in Iraqi Kurdistan, Tirana, Diyarbakir, Mardin and Elaionas. This is a mix of ethnographic recordings, oral epics, electromagnetic remnants of Aegean storms, percussive rituals, as well as code snippets of noise experiments of mine.
