CTM 2020 MusicMakers Hacklab, weeklong studio collaborative work and final performance. 

Radialsystem, Berlin, February 2020. Live visuals, violin, laptop and DIY electronics. The prepared violin was tuned in dissonant double strings, based on maqam modalities, and augmented with synth and live sampling elements. Textures and noises were feeding visuals based on liminal Arabic calligraphy. (w/ Mohamed Gaber, Klemens Kohlweis, Ivan Nikolic).
