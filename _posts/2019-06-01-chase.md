Chase. 
Sound/light installation with contact microphones, SuperCollider and robotic moving lights. Romantso, Athens, June 2019. 

Visitors were invited to critically approach their aural movement in space, diffusing sound and light perception. (w/ Dimitris Mitropoulos, Anna Mouzaki, Anastasis Prifits, Efi Stouri).
